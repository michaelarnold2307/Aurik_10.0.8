## Coding Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- **PEP 8:** Follow Python's style guide
- **Type Hints:** Use type annotations for function signatures
- **Docstrings:** Document all public functions/classes
- **Comments:** Explain complex logic, not obvious code

**Example:**

```python
def process_audio(
    audio: np.ndarray,
    sample_rate: int,
    material: MaterialType = MaterialType.VINYL
) -> PhaseResult:
    """
    Process audio with material-adaptive restoration.
    
    Args:
        audio: Input audio samples (mono or stereo)
        sample_rate: Sample rate in Hz
        material: Source material type
    
    Returns:
        PhaseResult with processed audio and metadata
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Code Organization

- **Modularity:** Keep functions small and focused
- **Separation of Concerns:** DSP logic separate from ML logic
- **Error Handling:** Use try-except with graceful fallbacks
- **Logging:** Use Python logging module, not print statements

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def process():
    try:
        # ML processing
        result = ml_algorithm()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"ML failed: {e}, falling back to DSP")
        result = dsp_fallback()
    return result
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Profile first:** Measure before optimizing
- **Vectorization:** Use NumPy operations, avoid Python loops
- **Parallelization:** Use ThreadPoolExecutor/ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound tasks
- **Memory:** Be mindful of large arrays, use generators when possible

---

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

All contributions must include tests:

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions/classes
- **Integration Tests:** Test phase interactions
- **End-to-End Tests:** Test full pipelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest tests/unit --disable-warnings --tb=short -q

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_v99_genre_schlager.py -v

# Run with coverage
pip install coverage
coverage run -m pytest tests/unit/
coverage report

# Run fast tests only (skip slow ML tests)
pytest tests/unit -m "not slow"
```

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
import numpy as np

def test_denoise_phase():
    """Test Phase 03 Denoise with synthetic audio"""
    # Arrange
    audio = np.random.randn(48000)  # 1 second at 48kHz
    phase = DenoisePhase()
    
    # Act
    result = phase.process(audio, sample_rate=48000, material_type='vinyl')
    
    # Assert
    assert result.success
    assert result.audio is not None
    assert len(result.audio) == len(audio)
    assert result.execution_time_seconds < 2.0  # <2× realtime
```

### Test Data

- **Synthetic Audio:** Generate test signals programmatically
- **Golden Samples:** Use `golden_samples/` for reference audio
- **Fixtures:** Share test data with pytest fixtures
