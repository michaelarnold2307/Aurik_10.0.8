"""backend/core/era_defect_patterns.py — Era × Material → typische Defektmuster

Aurik's autonomous decision-making depends on knowing *before* signal analysis
which defects are statistically probable for a given material and era.  This
knowledge base encodes decades of archival and mastering practice into a
lookup table so the :class:`~backend.core.defect_scanner.DefectScanner` can
weight its findings against realistic priors, and the
:class:`~backend.core.causal_defect_reasoner.CausalDefectReasoner` can predict
defects that may be present but below the detection threshold.
